use rubocop to autoformat code

color it depending on time to execute, number of times executed
 - number of times on the side, time to execute in the line color

how much coverage is provided only by that one test (uniqueness of test coverage)

What about code that is only sometimes not executed? How do we get average time? Solution: use total time, not average... maybe average of all runs that actually run the code?

Don't execute / report comments

Check code duplication
